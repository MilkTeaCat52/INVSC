[INVSC] Analysing ./examples/q6.scala...
[INVSC] Checking loop invariants and variants...
[INVSC] Consulting the Oxford examiners board...

./examples/q6.scala:9: error: The variant [The actual number we're guessing] * 2 - r is not a valid expression in the current context and does not decrease.
./examples/q6.scala:9: error: The invariant r = l * 2 is not maintained after the first loop iteration as both l and r are doubled.
./examples/q6.scala:14: error: The variant r - l is not guaranteed to strictly decrease in every iteration of the second loop.

Tutor's remarks: The code demonstrates a basic understanding of invariants and variants, but there are significant errors in their correctness and application.
